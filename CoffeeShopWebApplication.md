## Design

The application will feature a 'Warm & Modern Minimalist' design. It uses an earthy color palette (cream, coffee brown, sage green), elegant typography, and high-quality imagery to create a cozy, premium feel. The layout is clean, spacious, and responsive, built with custom-styled shadcn/ui components for a polished and intuitive user experience on both desktop and mobile.
